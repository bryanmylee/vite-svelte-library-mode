# Svelte library built with Vite is broken

The component library being tested against is [`@ally-ui/svelte-dialog@0.0.11`](https://github.com/ally-ui/ally-ui/tree/main/packages/dialog/svelte) which is built with Vite's library mode.

Run `npm run dev` to observe the uncaught error in the exported component.
